<p class="highlight">This is the first paragraph. It has a yellow background and bold text because it is assigned the 'highlight' class.</p>  

<p class="note">This is the second paragraph. It is italicized and has a dark green color because it is assigned the 'note' class.</p>  

<p>This is the third paragraph. It doesn't have a specific class assigned, so it uses the default paragraph style, which is a font size of 16px.</p>
